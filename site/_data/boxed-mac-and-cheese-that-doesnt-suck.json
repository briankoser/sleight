{"datemodified":"2014-07-05T03:10:51.118Z","name":"Boxed Mac & Cheese That Doesn't Suck","yield":"2-4 servings","ingredients":["2 Boxes of Mac & Cheese","Extra Virgin Olive Oil","Diced Onions (a couple handfuls)","Plain yogurt or sour cream","Milk","1 lb. bacon, fried crisp","1 tomato, chopped"],"instructions":["Cook the elbows, but make sure you don't overcook - use the LOW end of the time range on the box.","While those elbows are draining in a colander, cover the bottom of the same pan with olive oil (don't be too shy, but I use less oil than the amount of butter recommended on the box).","Dump those diced onions in there and lower the heat to medium.  We just want to get them barely translucent, so they lend a sweetness and no heat.","I put the elbows back in the pan at this point, and stir them up for a minute to get them hot and lubed.","Dump the box's cheese mix in, along with about two tablespoons of the yogurt (just eyeball it) and enough milk to loosen things up. I like to toss in some black pepper at this point, as much for the nose as for the tongue.","Stir on the heat until all the powder is melted and mixed. Add more milk/yogurt to get the consistency you want. Stir in bacon and tomato and serve."]}
