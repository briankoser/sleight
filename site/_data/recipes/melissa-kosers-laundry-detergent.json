Before grating the soap, let it sit out until completely dry (some moisture had crept into mine and it did not grate well). Washing soda can be found at WalMart in the detergent section. This recipe works just as well as store-bought detergent, and for way cheaper.","ingredients":["1 bar unscented soap","1 c. borax","1 c. washing soda"],"instructions":["*Finely* shred/grate the soap, then mix with borax and soda and store in a dry area. Use 1 Tbsp. per load (does not have to be heaping); add before starting water."]}
