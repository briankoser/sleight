Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice. Transfer to a medium container and chill in fridge.","Place raspberries and orange juice in blender and blend until smooth, then press mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove seeds (you may have to do this twice). Pour puree into chilled lemon mixture; stir, then cover and freeze until firm.","Let sorbet sit at room temp 20-30 minutes, or until no longer frozen solid. Blend in food processor once more, then return to freezer (you'll see the difference as it becomes smoother-looking). To serve, let stand at room temp 5 minutes before scooping."]}
