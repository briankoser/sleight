The bacon flavor seeps into the eggs while they bake, making them very savory.","yield":"12 \"muffins\"","ingredients":["Butter, for greasing","24 bacon strips, cooked but not crisp","12 eggs"],"instructions":["Lightly grease a muffin tin with butter. Tear bacon strips in half width-wise. Line the bottoms of each muffin cup with two bacon pieces, and line the sides with two more pieces; the bacon should now look like a little \"cup.\" Crack one egg into each cup.","Bake uncovered at 325 degrees for 12-18 minutes, or until whites are completely set and yolks begin to thicken but are not firm."]}
