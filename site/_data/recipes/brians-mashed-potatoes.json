Salt the water to taste and bring it to a boil. Make sure to use plenty of water.","Peel and cut the potatoes, the thinner the better. When the water comes to a boil, put potatoes in the pot, stirring occasionally.","Put butter and milk into a bowl and heat until hot.","Remove potatoes when they are soft all through, but before they get \"shaggy\" (usually 15-25 minutes).","Drain the potatoes in a colander, then put back into the pot. Turn the burner to low and steam the potatoes dry.","Remove potatoes from heat. Add milk/butter mixture and salt. Mash the potatoes until they reach \"fluffy mountain\" stage (about 2 minutes). A brief, efficient mashing keeps the potatoes from turning gummy.","Taste. Add more salt, butter, and milk until you are satisfied with taste and texture. Make sure not to undersalt; you will use more than you expect. Be generous with salt and butter, stingy with milk."]}
