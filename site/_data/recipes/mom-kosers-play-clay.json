Cook on medium heat, stirring continually until mixture thickens and bubbles (may get difficult to stir). Spoon onto board; cover with a damp cloth and let cool (in very humid climates you may not need the damp cloth, but you don't want the clay to dry out).","Knead clay smooth when cool enough to handle. Divide into batches. Add food coloring if desired (if wanting to use same color with entire batch, coloring may be added with the water). Store in tightly sealed plastic bag or a jar in fridge."]}
