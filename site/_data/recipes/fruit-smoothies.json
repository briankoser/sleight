We tried fresh ones, but they just did not give the same amount of flavor (even though they tasted great out of the smoothie). This smoothie is a staple in our house!","yield":"2 servings","ingredients":["2 bananas","8 *frozen* strawberries","orange juice","1 scoop Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream (or milk)"],"instructions":["Place bananas and strawberries in blender. Add desired amount of o.j. and blend, adding more until mixture reaches desired consistency and flavor. Add ice cream to make mixture thicker and creamier. Serve immediately.
