Drain.","Cover the bottom of the same pan with olive oil (don't be too shy). Cook onions in oil on medium heat. They should be barely translucent, so they lend a sweetness and no heat.","Put the elbows back in the pan at this point, and stir them up for a minute to get them hot and lubed.","Dump the cheese mixes in, along with about two heaping spoonfuls of sour cream (just eyeball it) and enough milk to loosen things up. Crack black pepper over the top of the whole pan, then stir everything together.","Stir on the heat until all the powder is melted and mixed. You may add more milk/yogurt at this point to get the consistency you want. Stir in bacon and tomato and serve."]}
