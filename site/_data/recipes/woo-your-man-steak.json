The key to even cooking is to use steaks that are not too thick; otherwise, the outside will burn while the inside remains uncooked. This steak tastes good cold in a sandwich, too.","yield":"2 steaks","ingredients":["3 Tbsp. lemon juice (or juice from one lemon)","1/2 c. soy sauce","3 Tbsp. olive oil","2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce","1 clove garlic, minced","chopped onion","2 steaks, 3/4\" thick"],"instructions":["Mix all ingredients except steak and pour into Ziplock bag. Add steak and marinate 4-12 hours in fridge, turning occasionally.","To cook, place heatproof cooling rack on a cookie sheet and place steaks on top. Broil on High for 35-45 minutes, turning every 10 minutes. Steaks should be medium-rare when done this way (although it may depend on how open you keep your oven door while broiling)."]}
