In large bowl, sprinkle gelatin on 1/2 c. cold water to soften; set aside.","In 2 qt. saucepan, heat granulated sugar, corn syrup, salt and water over low heat, stirring constantly until sugar is dissolved. Heat to boiling; cook without stirring to 250 degrees on candy thermometer. Remove from heat.","Slowly pour syrup into softened gelatin while beating with electric mixer on high speed. Beat until mixture is white; add peppermint extract and continue to beat until it has almost tripled in volume (if it starts climbing up your beaters, it's time to stop beating). Quickly pour into pan, scraping bowl clean; mixture will become too sticky if you don't move fast. Dust top with powdered sugar and let sit 8 hours.","Run a knife around edges of pan to loosen marshmallow mixture, then invert onto cutting board. Coat knife with powdered sugar repeatedly while cutting. I haven't yet figured out an easy way to cut these; I usually just drag a sharp knife through several times (try Googling for suggestions). When you pull pieces out, dip the cut sides in powdered sugar so they won't be sticky anymore.","Store in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 weeks."]}
